# NOTE!
Please do bear in mind that all these time and size tests are done under firefox.
All (if not, most) Chromium-based browsers will have an even faster loading times.
For example: the `home` page on firefox takes a couple hundred miliseconds to load vs a few seconds ~1.5s.
Chromium, on the other hand, loads the current page of arg-wiki (as of writing this disclaimer) in around a few hundred miliseconds while loading the new page (this one) takes around 20-ish ms (in the 20s of miliseconds)

### TL;DR
Each page's load time and download amount is tested with FireFox. Chromium is much more performant in loading. So your milage may vary on certain browsers.
