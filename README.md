</p>

This is a major reconstruction of the website. This project aims to provide opportunities to allow people with much weaker and older hardware with great and substantial limitations to load up the website and be able to have the same experience as the users with already powerful hardware.<br>
Here are the key major differences:

- Shrunk page sizes by at least and not limited to 2 to 10 times, allowing much more snappier load times, lowering user-bandwidth requirements <i>(see more over at the <u>/PageComparisons</u> folder)</i>.
- Fixed content symmetry.
- Improved source structure.
